Space Wonders
========

Space Wonders is a rework of the original and popular [Astronomy Picture of the Day](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html).

It lets you discover a picture a day about some of the most beautiful things in the universe.

This project is mainly for fun but feel free to use it!
It is built using the awesome [Tachyons](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons)
